Moisture content in foods plays a critical role in determining their stability, shelf life, and Protein solubility is influenced by various factors, including pH, temperature, ionic strength, and the specific characteristics of the protein itself. The experiment focuses on how pH affects the solubility of a protein powder. At a certain pH, proteins tend to have minimal solubility, known as the isoelectric point (pI), where the protein carries no net charge and thus aggregates or precipitates. At pH values away from the pI, proteins are more soluble due to their charged nature, which prevents aggregation. The solubility can be measured by separating the insoluble fraction and comparing it with the total protein initially dissolved.
