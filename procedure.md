<b>Requirements (Instruments, Chemicals & Other) : </b> <br>

1.	Protein powder <br>
2.	Analytical Balance <br>
3.	Conical flask <br>
4.	Petri-dish <br>
5.	Whatman filter paper <br>
6.	Convective hot air oven <br>

8.	Buffer solution <br>
9.	Measuring cylinder <br>
10.	Distilled water <br><br>

<b>Procedure : </b><br>

1.	Weigh 10g protein powder (S) in five different conical flasks.<br>
2.	Pour 100 ml buffer solutions of pH 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 6 and 8 in the five different proteins containing conical flask and marked as the A, B, C, D and E respectively.<br>
3.	Shake the flasks at 200 rpm for 10 min.<br>
4.	Filter the solution of each flask using Whatman filter paper.<br>
5.	Transfer filter paper containing insoluble matter inside the pre-weight petridish.<br>
6.	Put the Petridish in the oven and dry the content at 105Â°C for 3 hrs. <br>
7.	Record the weight of petridish after 3 hrs of drying.<br>
8.	Weigh Whatman filter paper and record the weight.<br>
9.	Calculate using formula: <br>
